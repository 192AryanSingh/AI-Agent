Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Its diameter is eleven times that of Earth. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm) and has 95 known moons. It has a very strong magnetic field and a stormy, dynamic atmosphere, including the famous Great Red Spot, which is a giant storm. Jupiter also has a ring system, although it is faint compared to those of Saturn. The planet has the shortest day of any planet in the solar system, taking only about 9.9 hours to complete a rotation. NASA's Juno spacecraft has been instrumental in providing detailed images and information about Jupiter's atmosphere and other characteristics.

Research on Classroom Entry Policies for Late Students: Many educational policies suggest that late students should generally be allowed entry to avoid causing disruption and to promote a sense of inclusion. Teachers usually have their own discretion to manage their classrooms and determine specific rules based on the context. It's often recommended that students who arrive late should enter quietly, and if possible, the entry should not disrupt the ongoing lesson. The flexibility in allowing late students can contribute positively to their educational experience and maintain classroom harmony.
